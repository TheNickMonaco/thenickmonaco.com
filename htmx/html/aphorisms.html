        <h1 class="small">Anything that can't be expressed in a sentence is born of weakness.<br/>Or, in Dionysian: Gods speak aphoristically.</h1>
        <h1 class="small">I am creativity become man.</h1>
        <h1 class="small">I am a Dionysian. I don't understand myself half the time.</h1>
        <h1 class="small">Art is meaning. Interpretations are everything.</h1>
        <h1 class="small">Even the way a Dionysian suffers is strong.<br/>They despise weakness &mdash; those that pity them.<br/>Or, in Dionysian: A Dionysian suffers strongly.</h1>
        <h1 class="small">That which has the best art is the best religion.</h1>
        <h1 class="small">He who delights in solitude is both a wild beast and a God.</h1>
        <h1 class="small">I am an atheist and a Christian.</h1>
        <h1 class="small">The strongest atheist, like the strongest Christian, believes in, not just the Bible, but all of religion, philosophy, music, all of history!</h1>
        <h1 class="small">Does the sun need reassurance that it is strong, beautiful? No, it just shines.</h1>
        <h1 class="small">Psychologists did to Nietzsche what Christians did to Jesus Christ &mdash; believing they understood them.</h1>
        <h1 class="small">"Nick Monaco" in Dionysian is, "People's champion, alone" &mdash; The solitude the sun experiences to shine for everyone.</h1>
        <h1 class="small">Philosophers aren't philosophers. Artists are.</h1>
        <h1 class="small">Ascribing fixed meaning to art is weak.<br/>I'm gonna reinterpret the Bible like how Kanye samples a song.</h1>
        <h1 class="small">Life is art. The world is your canvas.</h1>
        <h1 class="small">A Dionysian shows gratitude by conquering the world, "Look! What you gave me is eternal!"</h1>
        <h1 class="small">I was having a bad day until I remembered: I'm Nick Monaco.</h1>
        <h1 class="small">What do you call an atheist that walks like Jesus?</h1>
        <h1 class="small">I am sensitive to weakness.</h1>
        <h1 class="small">It is an attack on God to claim his word is understood.<br/>An understood idea is dead or decomposing.<br/>It is only through an artist's insult to God, their own interpretation, that God is revived.</h1>
        <h1 class="small">I am incoherent and delusional (like a true Dionysian). I paint with words, philosophies, religions, dogmas.</h1>
        <h1 class="small">The greatest are aware of their greatness, wearing it proudly, not humbly.</h1>
        <h1 class="small">A Dionysian must be prepared to sacrifice success in this life for success post-mortem.<br/>Or, in Dionysian: If you aim for success in this life you are not aiming high enough.</h1>
        <h1 class="small">What is this society's idea of success relative to those of legendary civilizations? A laughing stock.</h1>
